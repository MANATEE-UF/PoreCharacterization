Use PNG over JPG due to JPG having lossy compression during saving (causes binary image to not actually be binary).

Using categorial CE or softmax activation in last layer cause output of all 1.

Training on white pores (0) with black background (1) seems to perform better than vice-versa

Increasing timesteps between training and prediction increases resolution but shrinks pores as pred steps increase
    (e.g. training on 3 timesteps than predicting on 10)

To convert predicted image to binary, subtract the mode, multiply by 10, subtract the mean*2, multiply by 100

Increasing timesteps for training allows for further prediction
